Net-IP-Match-XS version 0.03
============================

NAME
    Net::IP::Match::XS - Efficiently match IP addresses against IP ranges
    with C.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires these other modules and libraries:

      perl >= 5.6.1

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::IP::Match::XS;
      my $match = match_ip( $ip_addr, $match_ip1, $match_ip2, ... );

DESCRIPTION
    Net::IP::Match::XS is based upon, and does the same thing as
    Net::IP::Match. The unconditionally exported subroutine 'match_ip'
    determines if the ip to match ( first argument ) matches any of the
    subsequent ip arguments. Match arguments may be absolute quads, as
    '127.0.0.1', or contain mask bits as '111.245.76.248/29'. A true return
    value indicates a match. It was written in C, rather than a macro,
    preprocessed through Perl's source filter mechanism ( as is
    Net::IP::Match ), so that the ip arguments could be traditional perl
    scalars. The C code is lean and mean ( IMHO ).

  Example in Apache/mod_perl
    I use this module in my Apache server's mod_perl DB logging script to
    determine if an incoming IP is 'remote' or 'local'. First, I set up some
    variables in httpd.conf:

      PerlSetvar DBILogger_local_ips '222.234.52.192/29'
      PerlAddvar DBILogger_local_ips '111.245.76.248/29'
      PerlAddvar DBILogger_local_ips '10.0.0.0/24'
      PerlAddvar DBILogger_local_ips '172.16.0.0/12'
      PerlAddvar DBILogger_local_ips '192.168.0.0/16'
      PerlAddvar DBILogger_local_ips '127.0.0.1'

    These are the ip addresses I want to be considered local. In the
    mod_perl module:

      my @local_ips = $r->dir_config( "DBILogger_local_ips" );
      my $local = match_ip( $incoming_ip, @local_ips );

    Now $local is just that, and I set the database key accordingly.

  EXPORT
    'match_ip', unconditionally.
